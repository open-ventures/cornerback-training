	I don't know your level, but I built this training program because on my journey to become a pro, I realized that a lot of other aspiring pro guys didn't know how to train.

	They would show up to professional tryouts and combines, sometimes totally unprepared for what that entailed, and sadly, it showed.

	I'm sure most of these guys worked hard, but unfortunately, many of them didn't understand or utilize important training principles in their training programs. They also didn't train in a sustained, goal oriented, structured way. 

	Unless you're dealing with the very best performance trainers, you probably aren't either.
 
	I quickly realized if this lack of preparation knowledge existed on the pro level, then it most surely existed on the high school and college levels.

	This program is the culmination of my 20 years as defensive back, under the tutelage of my father, who also played professionally as a defensive back, in combination with countless hours of human performance research and practice.

	Regardless of your level, if you stay consistent, and train hard. this training program will help you take your game to the next level.

	Thanks and Happy Training,<br><br>Dennis Bishop

	P.S. I will be constantly working to improve upon this program, and adding tools that will help DBs reach their goals faster.
