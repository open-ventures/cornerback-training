	I don't know your level, but I built this training program because on my journey to become a pro, I realized that a lot of other aspiring pro guys didn't know how to train.
</p>
<p>
	They would show up to professional tryouts and combines, sometimes totally unprepared for what that entailed, and sadly, it showed.
</p>
<p>
	I'm sure most of these guys worked hard, but unfortunately, many of them didn't understand or utilize important training principles in their training programs. They also didn't train in a sustained, goal oriented, structured way. 
</p>
<p>
	Unless you're dealing with the very best performance trainers, you probably aren't either.
</p> 
<p> 
	I quickly realized if this lack of preparation knowledge existed on the pro level, then it most surely existed on the high school and college levels.
</p>
<p>
	This program is the culmination of my 20 years as defensive back, under the tutelage of my father, who also played professionally as a defensive back, in combination with countless hours of human performance research and practice.
</p>
<p>
	Regardless of your level, if you stay consistent, and train hard, this training program will help you take your game to the next level.

	P.S. I will be constantly working to improve upon this program, and adding tools that will help DBs reach their goals faster.
